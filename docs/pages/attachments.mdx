# Attachments

## Getting started

Add your first attachments to Uplo. For example we will add `avatar` for `User` and
multiple `images` for `Post`

```ts
const uplo = Uplo({
  // ... other Uplo config
  attachments: {
    user: {
      avatar: true, // You can pass true if you use default options.
    },
    post: {
      images: { multiple: true }
    }
  }
})
```

## Options

* `multiple = false` (*optional*): Specify if supports multiple attachments on single record.
* `serviceName` (*optional*): You can provide custom service
* `directUpload = true` (*optional*): You can disable direct uploads for
    specific attachments if needed


## Find attachment

We can find our attachment by specifying `User` ID.

### Single

```ts
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.findOne()

console.log(attachment.blob.url());
```

### Multiple

```ts
const attachments = await uplo.attachments.post(123).images.findMany()
```

## Detach attachment

You can detach attachment from record

### Single

```ts
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.detach()
```

### Multiple

Detach one attachment

```ts
const attachments = await uplo.attachments.post(postId).images.detach(attachmentId)
```

Detach all attachments

```ts
const attachments = await uplo.attachments.post(postId).images.detachMany()
```

## Attach file

Attach file from file path

```ts
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.attachFile({
  filePath: '/home/images/image.png',
  contentType: 'image/png',
})
```

Attach file with content

```ts
const content = 'This is my file' // Can be string, Buffer

const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.attachFile({
  content,
  contentType: 'text/plain',
  fileName: 'text.txt',
})
```

## Attach signed file

When you use Direct Upload, you get Signed ID. Then you need manually to attach
signed ID to your record. How to get Signed ID, please view Client documentation

```ts
const signedId = req.params['signedId']
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.attachSignedFile(signedId)
```
