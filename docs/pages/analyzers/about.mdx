# About analyzers

Analzyers are used to get information about blob and store it to metadata. For
example, you can get Image `width` and `height` with image analyzer.

## Usage

Usually you want to run these in delayed jobs to avoid request blocking. For
example, you can add `afterAttach` callback to Uplo and schedule blob analyze
job.

```ts
import ImageAnalyzer from '@uplo/analyzer-image';

const uplo = Uplo({
  analyzers: [
    ImagenAnalyzer()
  ],
  callbacks: {
    afterAttach: async ({ blob }) => {
      await DelayedJob.performLater('uplo-analyze-blob', { id: blob.id });
    },
  }
})
```
and in delayed job you can find blob and call analyze

```ts
import uplo from '../uplo';

const uploAnalyzeBlob = async ({ id }: { id: ID }) => {
  if (!id) return;

  const blob = await uplo.$findBlob(id);
  if (!blob) return;

  return await blob.analyze();
};
```
